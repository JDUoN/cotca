Participants
<strong>Joanna Allan</strong> currently works at Northumbria University. She holds a Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship for a project investigating how imaginaries of wind and sun impact on politics mediated by energy systems. More widely, she is interested in nonviolent resistance movements, resistance poetry and the gender of authoritarianism and resistance. Regionally, Joanna's work has focused on Western Sahara and Equatorial Guinea, and on the Equatoguinean and Saharawi diaspora communities in Spain. Joanna's first book <em>Silenced Resistance: Women, Dictatorships, and Genderwashing in Western Sahara and Equatorial Guinea</em> (Wisconsin University Press, 2019) was shortlisted for the 2020 African Studies Association Fage and Oliver Prize for best book on Africa, and was runner up in the 2020 International Studies Association's biennial Feminist Theory and Gender Studies Book Prize. The book has been reviewed in the <em>Journal of Spanish Cultural Studies</em>, <em>Africa Review</em>, <em>Midwest Book Review</em>, <em>Nomadic Peoples Journal</em> and the <em>International Journal of African Historical Studies</em>. Before beginning her PhD, Joanna worked at National Energy Action, the UK Consortium on HIV/AIDS and International Development and London Councils European Service. She has been part of the Saharawi solidarity movement for years, including as President of Western Sahara Resource Watch until 2017.

<strong>Sébastien Boulay</strong> is an anthropologist, and a Senior Lecturer at the University of Paris (Faculty Societies and Humanities), and member of UMR 196 CEPED (Centre Population &amp; Développement). He has been conducting ethnographic field research since 1999 in Mauritania, and in Western Sahara since 2011. His current work focuses on the role of artistic productions (notably satirical and humorous, but also elegiac) and new media in the political struggles at work since the 1960s in the region. He has just devoted several years of research to collecting, translating and analysing a corpus of poems and songs paying tribute to deceased figures of West-Saharan political life, and in particular to figures of martyrs, a corpus that allows him to apprehend the West-Saharan political field from an original angle. He is also very interested in the evolution of the place of Moorish griots in political and media life since the 1950s and in the sense of the political commitment of West Saharan artists, whether griots or non-griots. He co-founded the International Academic Observatory of Western Sahara in 2016 and recently headed with Francisco Freire Culture et Politique dans l’Ouest saharien: Arts, Activismes et État dans un Espace de Conflits (L’Étrave, 2017); with Francesco Correale Sahara Occidental: Conflit Oublié, Population en Mouvement (PUFR, 2018); with Sylvie Fanchette, La question des Echelles en Sciences Humaines et Sociales (Éditions de l’IRD, 2019). He has just made a first film with Michel Tabet on the meaning of martyrdom in the Saharawi revolutionary tradition (<em>SAHARA-Les Voix des Martyrs</em>, 2020, 75’).

<strong>Abdessamad El Montassir</strong> is a multi-disciplinary artist. His research is centered on a trilogy: the right to forget/being forgotten, fictional and visceral narratives, and the trauma of anticipation. In his body of work, the artist invites us to rethink histories and cartographies through collective or fictional narratives and immaterial archives. His projects explore the ways in which traumas affect the behaviours and socio-political contexts of individuals and reveal processes of story-telling and history-writing. Abdessamad El Montassir takes stock of the knowledge on/of non-human identities (plants, wind, landscapes) in order to spark new ways of thinking about our environment. Abdessamad El Montassir  has participated in several national and international exhibitions, including Ce qui s’oublie et ce qui reste (curated by Meriem Berrada and Isabelle Renard at National Museum of Immigration History in Paris); Surgir des cendres (in the frame of Chroniques - Biennale of Digital Imagination in Aix-Marseille); Invisible (curated by Alya Sebti for the 13th Biennale of Contemporary African Art of Dakar and for ifa-Galerie in Berlin); Leave No Stone Unturned (curated by Clelia Coussonnet at Le Cube - independent art room in Rabat); De liens et d’exils (La Villa Empain - Fondation Boghossian in Brussels); Al Amakine (11th Rencontres de Bamako); Saout Africa(s) (in the context of DOCUMENTA 14 at SAVVY Contemporary in Berlin).

                    <p class="post-list__paragraph">This conversation with artist Hyunhye (Angela) Seo will explore how colonialism and occupation not only shape the occupied culture, but how that culture, adapts, inherits and responds, and the melding of native/original culture and coloniser culture into something familiar yet new.


Participants
<strong>Hyunhye (Angela) Seo</strong> is an artist exploring experimental composition and expression of sound and its manifestations within space and body. She is a member of the musical group Xiu Xiu, in which she extends the band’s visual themes to immigrant diaspora, post-colonial spirituality and ritualism, and exotification/fetishisation via videos that have been featured in film festivals around the world. She has performed in collaboration with various artists spanning the visual and performance world, including with Danh Vo ("Metal" at The Kitchen, and "Deforms the Unborn" at the Guggenheim NYC), and the Berlin-based Cheap Collective (featuring Vaginal Davis, Susanne Sachsse and Marc Siegel). Recently, her solo album, <em>Strands</em>, explores abstract soundscapes built with processed percussion, improvisational piano, and dark ambient material. Her sound installations in relation to this work create an immersive territory that compels the listener to question how they carry the immediate and lingering impact of sound (her website).

<strong>Russ Skelchy</strong> is an interdisciplinary scholar specialising in the popular musics of Indonesia and Malaysia. He received his PhD in Ethnomusicology (2015) and MA in Southeast Asian Studies (2010) from the University of California, Riverside.

                    <p class="post-list__paragraph">This conversation with artist/activist Shaq Koyok will cover art and the issues faced today by Indigenous communities in Malaysia (including land rights, deforestation, poverty, racial discrimination and religious conversion).
Participants
<strong>Gaik Cheng Khoo</strong> obtained her BA (English) from The University of Texas (Austin), then she moved to Canada for her MA (English) and PhD (Interdisciplinary Studies) at the University of British Columbia. She spent two years as a postdoctoral fellow at the Asia Research Institute (ARI-NUS) in Singapore in 2004-05, where she built up invaluable networks in the region before becoming a lecturer at the Australian National University, where she taught gender, cultural studies and Southeast Asian cinema (2005-2012). She is currently the Director of the University of Nottingham Asia Research Institute, Malaysia. Gaik's work focuses on cinema and independent filmmaking in Malaysia; cosmopolitan spaces including public eating places like <em>kopitiam</em> and <em>mamak</em> stalls; race, religion and the politics of identity; multiculturalism and food. She is focusing on Korean migrants in Malaysia as exemplary of generational and attitudinal changes among South Koreans. As transnational migrants on the move for studies, work, play, or retirement, they register in complex, layered and sometimes contradictory ways, a kind of resistance to traditional stereotypes of South Korean middle class aspirations and status. Gaik is interested in how temporality, modernity and happiness figure in their migration and settlement. Her most recent research is on a political economy of the Malaysian durian, focusing on the supply chain.

<strong>Shaq Koyok</strong> (b. 1985 Kampung Pulau Kempas in Banting, Selangor, Malaysia) is a contemporary artist from the Indigenous Temuan tribe of Selangor. He started painting with oil pastels at five years of age to express his feelings. He went on to pursue Fine Art at Universiti Teknologi MARA. In was the trauma of watching land developers encroaching onto the jungle around his village and plundering the forest in the 1990s and early 2000s that fueled his passion for art and activism. Shaq produces works that reflect his growing concern about the world, environmental degradation and the fate of the Orang Asli people (which translates as "Original People") in Malaysia. Specialising in portraits, his work has been shown in Britain, Australia and the United States, as well as Malaysia. In 2017, Shaq won the Merdeka Award for International Attachment.

<strong>Vuth Lyno</strong> (b. 1982, Phnom Penh) is an artist, curator and educator interested in space, cultural history and knowledge production. His artworks often engage with micro and overlooked histories, notions of community, place-making, and production of social relations. He works across various media, including photography, video, sculpture, light, and sound. He often constructs architectural bodies as situations for interaction. He introduces human stories and knowledge within these installations by drawing on a wide range of materials such as original interviews, artifacts, and newly made objects. His artistic and curatorial practice is participatory in nature, engaging mutual and communal learning, experimentation, and aims to share multiple voices in the production of meaning. He believes in the potency of collectivity, storytelling, and the agency of cultural objects as potential pathways to reimage our sociality. Alongside his individual artistic practice, he is also a member of Stiev Selapak collective which founded and co-runs Sa Sa Art Projects, a long-term initiative committed to the development of contemporary visual arts landscape in Cambodia. Together with the collective, he teaches, initiates, and innovates art programs facilitating a growing and more critically conscious community.

                    <p class="post-list__paragraph">Roundtable on Ahmed Saadawi's <em>Frankenstein in Baghdad</em>
Ahmed Saadawi’s novel <em>Frankenstein in Baghdad </em>(Oneworld Publications, 2018 [2013]), a take on Mary Shelley's famous book, serves as a metaphor for cyclical violence and the precariousness of daily life in Iraq under American occupation. It tells the story of the Whatsitsname, a creature made of the limbs of people who died in terror attacks in Baghdad. Prompted by the death of a friend, junk dealer Hadi collects and sows these body parts together to form a "complete" body that can be given a proper funeral. Unsurprisingly, his attempt goes awry. Possessed by the spirit of one of the dead, the Whatsitsname goes on a killing spree to avenge the innocents whose flesh it is composed of. When the revenge has been carried out, the body part drops off and must be replaced with fresh ones. As the line between victims and perpetrators becomes murkier, the Whatsitsname realises that its mission is just an endless and pointless task. Saadawi’s creature is more than the sum of its parts. It is a monstrous, more-than-human body whose ongoing reconfiguration reflects the ever-changing reality of occupation itself. As such, the Whatsitsname is not only an alternative epistemology or a stratigraphical instrument of exploration, but also the entry point into the becoming of occupation.
Participants
<strong>Jonathan Luke Austin</strong> is Assistant Professor of International Relations at the University of Copenhagen. He is also Lead Researcher for the Violence Prevention (VIPRE) Initiative at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva. Austin’s research agenda is currently orientated around four main axes: i. the ontology and microsociology of political violence; ii. the relationships between technology, design theory and world politics; iii. the political status of aesthetics, and; iv. the contemporary state of scientific critique. Alongside these foci, Austin possesses a decade of research and field experience in the Middle East (Syria, Lebanon, Iraq) and regularly consults for NGOs and the media on current events. He has contributed to essays collections, reports, and journals such as Frame: Journal of Literary Studies, Security Dialogue, European Journal of International Relations, and International Political Sociology. He is currently working on two books, <em>Small Worlds of Violence: A Global Grammar for Torture</em> and <em>Unmaking Global Violence</em> (his website).

<strong>Dom Davies</strong> is a Senior Lecturer in English at City, University of London, where he is also the Programme Director for the BA English. He holds a DPhil and British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowship from the University of Oxford. He is the author of two books, <em>Imperial Infrastructure and Spatial Resistance in Colonial Literature, 1880-1930</em> (2017) and <em>Urban Comics: Infrastructure and the Global City in Contemporary Graphic Narratives</em> (2019), along with many articles and book chapters broadly in the field of colonial and postcolonial writing, visual culture, and critical infrastructure studies. He is the co-editor of <em>Planned Violence: Post/Colonial Urban Infrastructure, Literature &amp; Culture</em> (2018) and two other edited collections. He is currently writing a trade book about the cultural, regional, and post-imperial politics of the British government's "levelling-up agenda", which is due out with Lawrence &amp; Wishart in 2022

<strong>Kobi Kabalek</strong> is Assistant Professor of Holocaust Studies and Visual Studies in Germanic and Slavic Languages and Literatures and Jewish Studies, Penn State University. He earned his PhD in history from the University of Virginia, with a dissertation on "The Rescue of Jews and the Memory of Nazism in Germany" (2013). In 2014-2017, he was a post-doctoral fellow at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem as part of the ERC project "Experience, Judgment, and Representation of WWII in an Age of Globalization", and examined conflicting perspectives concerning the war in Mandatory Palestine and their impact on the postwar historiography of Israel and Zionism. His research focuses on historical perceptions, moral sentiments and memory in film, literature, auto/biography, oral narratives, art, etc., in German, Israeli, and global Holocaust history. He currently explores marginalized and extreme phenomena in Holocaust testimonies, historical writing, and popular culture – with special attention to the role of fantasy, imagination, and horror – and their impact on our understanding and representation of the Holocaust.

<strong>Rúben Leitão Serém</strong> is an Assistant Professor in History at the University of Nottingham since 2019. He specialises on the social history of the Spanish Civil War of 1936-1939, General Franco's dictatorship (1939-1975), and its traumatic legacy in present-day Spain. A fan of microhistory and memory studies, Rúben has studied the origins, course, and reverberations of this brutal conflict in southern Spain, subsuming it into the wider historiography of nationalism in twentieth-century Iberia. More recently, Rúben has focused his research on the so-called "memory wars" in twenty-first-century Spain, in particular, on their social and cultural ramifications, and their use to feed several – and antipodal – nationalistic waves within the country (Spanish and Catalan nationalism). With around 100,000 victims of the civil war still lying in mass graves all over the country, from roadside ditches to mines and wells, Spain is presently only second to Cambodia in the total number of disappeared citizens. Deep and bitter divisions persist on how to deal with these bodies, for their presence and visibility has the power to erode the political consensus established during Spain’s transition to democracy during the 1970s. At a social level, the undignified status of the dead has only served to augment the trauma experienced by survivors and their descendants. In this respect, Franco’s project to instil fear and divide the nation lives on long after the death of its architect, finding nourishment on its executed victims. Rúben is the author of <em>Conspiracy, Coup d’état and Civil war in Seville, 1936-1939: History and Myth in Francoist Spain</em> (Eastbourne: Sussex Academic Press, 2017). More recently, he has published "Muerte y miseria en la «Ciudad de Dios»: El virreinato de Queipo de Llano en Sevilla" in Del Arco Blanco, Miguel Ángel (ed), <em>Los «años del hambre»: Historia y memoria de la posguerra franquista</em> (Madrid: Marcial Pons, 2020). Rúben is currently working on the involvement of the ultranationalist Portuguese Estado Novo dictatorship in the Spanish Civil War.

<strong>Annie Webster</strong> studied English and Related Literature at the University of York and Arabic at the University of Edinburgh before completing her Wolfson-funded PhD on post-2003 Iraqi fiction at SOAS in 2020 with a thesis titled Stories of Creative Destruction in post-2003 Iraqi Fiction. She has since been teaching modern Arabic literature at King's College London and the University of Cambridge. She has published a number of articles on contemporary Iraqi literature, including "Ahmed Saadawi's Frankenstein in Baghdad: A Tale of Biomedical Salvation?" in <em>Literature and Medicine</em> (2018), "Indexing War: The Craft of the Catalogue in Sinan Antoon's The Book of Collateral Damage" in <em>Wasafiri</em> (2021), and a chapter on literary depictions of occupied Baghdad forthcoming in <em>The Routledge Companion of Literary Urban Studies</em>. She has also contributed pieces to the TORCH blog, the MULOSIGE blog, and Arablit.org. More recently, she has developed an interest in contemporary Iraqi art which she has written about for ArtsCabinet.org, and is working with the artist Hanaa Malallah on the forthcoming exhibition "Co-Existent Ruins" (SOAS, 2022). She is currently preparing a monograph from her thesis which explores how contemporary Iraqi literature commemorates the human and environmental fallout of the 2003 Iraq War. Investigating how these texts have been incorporated into the international literary marketplace and framed by neoliberal paradigms of empathy, she draws attention to the various modes of linguistic, cultural and material translation that these texts undergo. She also highlights intertextual links with classical Arabic literature that have thus far been overlooked. More broadly her research explores political and literary ecologies of war.</p>

          <h3 class="text-overflow">The Malayan Emergency: Digital Map</h3>
                    <p class="post-list__paragraph"><strong>Introduction</strong>
Spaces of the Malayan Emergency is a digital map created as part of the ERC-funded COTCA Project. It is an interactive map of British Malaya in the 1950s, and is the first such map to ever be compiled using data related to the spatial dynamics of the Emergency and its related resettlement policies.

The map is designed to highlight the variety of spatial and cartographic features that were hallmarks of the Emergency period in Malaya, including White and Black Areas, New Villages, Regrouping Areas and Detention Camps. Each layer of the map includes clickable data points that contain information about each spatial feature, including population figures, village class types and the source materials that list each location. In its totality, the map provides an approximation of how Malaya’s spatial environment was transformed under British colonial rule during the Malayan Emergency, and the ways in which the geography of Malaya was reshaped by British policies during this period.



The data for this map was gathered from archives in Malaysia, the United Kingdom and elsewhere, as well as from a wide range of published secondary historical materials. We have made the geodata and map layers for this project publicly available. Users can access the data files by clicking on the red “View Map” button below.

The map was generated using Mapbox. Dr David Baillargeon is the lead organiser, researcher and “map maker” for this phase of the COTCA Project; his work with the data provided in this map will appear in an article entitled “Spaces of Occupation: Colonial Enclosure and Confinement in British Malaya”, forthcoming in the <em>Journal of Historical Geography</em>.
Spatial Categories
The spaces that are covered in this digital map include the following:
1. Black Areas / White Areas
Black Areas and White Areas were created in September 1953 under the direction of Sir Gerald Templer. Black Areas, which on the digital map are symbolised using a single polygon feature, were areas in Malaya that represented high-risk environments for anti-colonial “terrorist” activity. These spatial zones were subject to a variety of repressive government policies, including but not limited to curfews, food restrictions and travel bans. White Areas, however, existed in opposition to Black Areas. While the denotation of a “White” area meant the relaxing of some repressive restrictions enacted under the Emergency orders – mainly curfews and food controls – it was also meant to symbolise to the public the benefits of resisting communism and working closely with the colonial authorities. With time, however, the government expanded the programme, pronouncing large areas across Malaya “White” in an effort to instill hope for Malaya’s population. Such declarations were accompanied by the publication of a map in local periodicals and government gazettes that included the precise contours of the area in question, as well as literature about the new “White” area regulations, written in both Chinese and Malay. While information about White and Black Areas can be found in a variety of locations, the specific details of the Black Areas polygon in the digital map is copied from data found at The National Archives (London), Colonial Office files, CO 1030/1, Emergency Regulations: Declaration of “White Areas”.
2. New Villages
The British colonial government in Malaya created New Villages to relocate the colony’s large rural ethnic Chinese population into more concentrated and governable spaces. The government took these actions beginning in 1950 under the Briggs Plan in an effort to cut off supplies – mainly food, money and military provisions – to the MCP and MNLA, who were largely based in the jungle. These New Villages, which were initially labelled as “resettlement areas”, were then sectioned off using barbed wire and perimeter fencing, and all movement in and out of the villages was strictly controlled. British planners incorporated a number of common buildings and communal sites across New Village spaces, including schools, community centres and garden plots. Although statistics on these resettlement efforts vary, the British forcibly relocated approximately 500,000 people into around 450 New Villages across British Malaya. The vast majority of those resettled in New Villages were ethnic Chinese “squatters” who, until the Malayan Emergency, had been living throughout the Malay interior. Although statistics related to resettlement sites exists in a variety of published and archival sources, the most comprehensive list of New Villages is found in W. C. S. Corry’s 1954 study, <em>A General Survey of New Villages</em>. This list provided the data source for the New Villages detailed in this digital map.

It should be noted that while most layers within the digital map have limited statistical information, New Villages are an exception. This is because the data for New Villages is far more robust than for other spatial categories within the map. Because of this, rather than simply providing the name and source information for each site, the clickable data box for each New Village contains information about the place name, approximate population, type of local government, and “category” of construction. While most of this data is self-explanatory, it should be noted that the “category” designation for each New Village represents the following: (A) refers to New Villages that were entirely new in their creation; (B) refers to New Villages built around smaller old villages that were then absorbed into the New Village; and (C) refers to New Villages that were suburbs or appendages to already existing towns or large villages. The definitions for these categories was found in Arkib Negara Malaysia, ANM, 1979/0006541, Statistical Information Concerning New Villages.
3. Regrouped Malay <em>Kampongs</em>
One spatial designation rarely discussed within the historiographical literature on the Malayan Emergency is the Regrouped Malay <em>Kampong</em>. According to Paul Markandan, whose 1954 book, <em>The Problem of New Villages in Malaya</em>, represents one of the few secondary sources on this topic, the regrouping of Malay <em>kampongs </em>(or villages) began across the colony after 1952 in an effort to resettle Malay rural dwellers closer to main roads and police protection. There were many differences between these regrouping spaces and New Villages. First, Regrouped Malay <em>Kampongs </em>primarily consisted of Malay people, rather than those in the Chinese community. Second, the regrouping of Malay people occurred voluntarily instead of forcibly, and many Malay people who resettled were compensated for doing so. Third, and perhaps most importantly, these spaces were not subject to spatial control in the same ways in which New Villages were. In fact, instead of barbed wire fencing, perimeter lighting and the construction of recreation and educational centres, Regrouped Malay <em>Kampongs </em>contained few if any of these attributes, and local Malay villagers often had to finance the building of their own dwellings and communal institutions. Security for these villages was provided by the colonial Home Guard. Although statistics about Regrouped Malay <em>Kampongs </em>are limited and colonial administrators did not record their numbers in every state, the data for regrouping areas included in the digital map were found in the Arkib Negara Malaysia, ANM, 1979/0006541, Statistical Information Concerning New Villages. Data is provided for the states of Johore, Kelantan, and Pahang.
4. Labour Regroupments
Another spatial category novel to the Malayan Emergency that receives little attention in the scholarly literature is the Labour Regroupment. Labour regrouping occurred at large rubber plantations and mining sites, most of which were owned by Western companies. The British colonial government considered labour regrouping necessary because, at the onset of the Emergency, many workers at these extractive and agricultural sites – whether Chinese, Malay or South Asian – lived in rural areas outside the boundaries of the company lease. Labour regrouping meant that companies were required to resettle their workers within the grounds of their estate to prevent them from being attacked by communist insurgents or, conversely, to prevent them from aiding the MCP and MNLA. Labour regrouping, however, was controversial, especially within the commercial community. Because regrouping forced firms to construct new living quarters and other amenities for their workers, many companies appealed to the colonial government to help finance such measures, which the British administration was reluctant to do. Nevertheless, labour regrouping occurred on a large scale throughout the colony. Unfortunately, the only statistics that we’ve discovered for such measures exist for the state of Pahang. This data, which is made available in the digital map, was found in the Arkib Negara Malaysia, ANM, 1979/0006541, Statistical Information Concerning New Villages.
5. Detention Camps
The final spatial designation rendered in the digital map is Detention Camps. Although few in number and most often located in Malaya’s urban centres, Detention Camps operated as sites of incarceration, rehabilitation or “repatriation” throughout the colony. This category, it should be noted, is varied in its orientation. Although five of the spaces defined as “Detention Camps” were noted to exist in 1951 – one in Tanjong Bruas (Malacca), one in Majeedi (Johore), one in Pulau Jerejak (Penang), one in Ipoh (Perak) and one in Kluang (Johore) – there are two other sites listed in this category that are not strictly Detention Camps. This includes a “Transit Camp” in Port Swettenham and a “Rehabilitation Camp” in Taiping. The latter such facility was noted as housing Chinese people between the ages of 16 and 40 who were specially selected from the other Detention Camps to receive four to six months of vocational training. These inmates would later be re-released into the general population. In total, in December 1950, approximately 10,241 people were noted as being in detention. Data for these camps was found in The National Archives (London), Colonial Office files, CO 537/7270, Malaya: Detention, Repatriation and Resettlement of Chinese.
Limitations of the Map
The Spaces of the Malayan Emergency digital map provides an interactive tool to investigate and visualise the spatial features of the Malayan Emergency. Nevertheless, the map has a number of limitations that are worth noting.

Rather than operating as a StoryMap or a map that reveals change over time, this map provides a visual snapshot of a particular moment in time during the Malayan Emergency. Roughly speaking, that moment is the year 1954. We chose to create a “static” map for a variety of reasons. First, the data and statistics related to the Emergency – particularly the names and locations of New Villages – were best reported and most readily available for the period around 1954. We thus chose this moment as being representative of a time when many of the Emergency’s unique spatial features were all in place territorially – for example, a moment when most New Villages and Regrouping Areas had already been built - but prior to a time when some other significant spatial categories – mainly Black Areas – still existed on a map. In other words, while prior to around 1952, many New Villages and Regrouping Areas had yet to exist in the colony and are therefore unable to be mapped, after around 1955, many Black Areas in Malaya had turned into White Areas.

These realities also make the creation of a StoryMap difficult. While the strength of a StoryMap is in its focus on temporality, the data and statistics that are available in the archival record about these spatial features – with the possible exception of New Villages – is largely incomplete. While there is therefore much value in showing how British administrators created New Villages in the colony over time, it would be nearly impossible to do so while also including other spatial categories created during the Emergency, including Regrouped Malay <em>Kampongs </em>and Labour Regroupments. In addition, because the exact cartographic contours of White and Black Areas shifted rapidly over the Emergency period, the data available in the archival record would make it difficult to accurately track these variations over time.

Even still, the use of a “static” map creates the appearance that the geography of the Emergency was “fixed” in its spatiality, which most certainly was not the case. This map merely represents an approximation of the spatial transformation that occurred in Malaya during the Emergency period. In other words, the map should not be considered a final statement on what the Emergency “looked like” during the 1940s and 1950s, but rather a visual tool designed to help scholars and the public better understand the scale of the spatial transformation that occurred during the conflict.

The other major limitation of this map is related to data. While in some cases – such as for New Villages – statistics and information about different sites of occupation is readily available, that is not the case for all spatial designations referenced in the digital map. Statistics for Regrouped Malay <em>Kampongs </em>and Labour Regroupments, for example, were not always reported by British officials in the colony, and the available information depends heavily on how particular state administrators – i.e. officials in Johore, Pahang, or Perak – listed particular sites.

This latter point on reporting data is important. Although a certain site may have been listed as a New Village in one source, for instance, that same site may be listed as a different spatial category elsewhere in the archive. In such cases, we relied on published sources – particularly Corry’s <em>A General Survey of New Villages</em> – to provide a more final assessment of how a site should appear in the digital map. Nonetheless, it should be noted that data points in the digital map are fluid in their orientation, and that British officials and members of the local community may have defined that site differently than what exists in the archival record.

Similarly related to issues about data, there are questions involving the location of certain place names within the map. While some New Villages, for example, remained inhabited and even grew in population and territory over the post-colonial period, others – particularly those in more rural spaces – were later abandoned. Some others changed their names. This means that while some sites are easy to geolocate (and, it should be noted, this represents the vast majority of these spaces), others are much more difficult to find. In some cases, when a place name may have gone out of favour but road names and commercial enterprises happened to retain the earlier place name, we used guesswork to estimate the location of a particular space. However, it should be noted that not all locations are in the precise place where they may have existed originally.

Finally, we chose not to include photographs of specific sites that are listed in the map. This is because although there are a number of excellent online digital databases that include photography from the Emergency period, very little of that material is catalogued as being from a particular location. In other words, there are many photographs of “New Villages” in the archival record, but few that record the actual place name of each New Village site. Because of this, and because visual materials could only be found for a tiny fraction of the sites included in the digital map (less than 2 per cent of the locations featured in the map), we decided against including photographic representations in our database.</p>

          <h3 class="text-overflow">The Daminhui: A propaganda agency in occupied China</h3>
                    <p class="post-list__paragraph">

The Daminhui (lit., "Great People's Association") was organised by the Japanese special service in Shanghai in 1938,[1] but was officially directed by the veteran Kuomintang member Wen Zongyao in Japanese-occupied east and central China.[2] It has been described as the "flagship enterprise of the Reformed Government [of the ROC]."[3] The Daminhui was responsible for a variety of propaganda work, and learnt its skills directly from propaganda organisations in north China, especially the Xinminhui. Within the Daminhui's Propaganda Department worked Chinese graphic artists, journalists, dramatists, and activists. The Daminhui made a particular name for itself in mobilizing local communities for pro-occupation celebrations.[4]



Much of the propaganda work undertaken by the Daminhui (and reproduced in its house pictorials like <em>New China</em>) looked remarkably similar to the "salvationist" (<em>jiuguo</em>) propaganda that had been developed by the Chinese resistance in Wuhan in 1938.[5] This was because a number of the Daminhui's affiliated agencies were specifically designed to emulate what the Japanese saw as effective methods of persuasion developed by the Chinese resistance early in the war.

Nonetheless, the Daminhui developed its own "brand." It operated under a logo comprised of a five-pointed star and a crescent moon. The influence of the Daminhui would continue to be felt in occupied east China through until 1945, as many of its members joined the ranks of Wang Jingwei's government at its formation in 1940.

          <h3 class="text-overflow">&#8220;Angel of Peace (<em>heping tianshi </em>)&#8221;:<br>Icon of Occupation in Wartime China</h3>
                    <p class="post-list__paragraph">In pre-WWII Shanghai, one of the most recognisable landmarks on the city's Bund had been Henry Fehr's art nouveau Allied War Memorial, first erected in 1924, and featuring at its top a statue of a winged Victory. According to Robert Bickers, the monument was so dominant a sight in Shanghai that it made its way into the city's culture. It even made an appearance in the 1937 film <em>Street Angel</em> (<em>Malu Tianshi</em>), directed by Yuan Muzhi.[1] This may help explain why the statue came to be referred to colloquially in the city either as the "Angel of Peace" (<em>heping tianshi</em>) or the "Victory Angel" (s<em>hengli tianshi</em>) during the 1930s. As Paul Bevan has shown, the figure was also utilised in social and political cartoons by the likes of Zhang Guangyu in this same period.[2]



&nbsp;

Following the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, however, Fehr's <em>Victory</em> was given a new significance for a variety of Japanese client states. Even prior to the establishment of the Reorganised National Government (RNG) in 1940, for example, the figure was worked into occupation propaganda in eastern China, with the notion of an "angel of peace" resonating with both Japanese client states set up in 1938 which promoted a negotiated peace with Japan, and with Wang Jingwei's "Peace Movement" (<em>Heping yundong</em>) after 1939. Fehr's figure was appropriated in the same year as into the cover design for one of the main vehicles for the Peace Movement in Shanghai, the periodical <em>Gengsheng</em> (Rebirth).

Under the RNG, Fehr's figure was transformed into an "goddess of peace" (<em>h</em><em>eping nüshen</em>), and was regularly featured in depictions of the Shanghai streetscape in RNG-sponsored graphic art. Indeed, the RNG "angel of peace" motif into the visual landscape of the RNG well beyond Shanghai, and wherever references to anthropomorphised peace were useful. In some instances, children dressed up as the "angel of peace" when publicly commemorating important dates on the RNG calendar. Elsewhere, Fehr's monument was re-imagined in rural Chinese landscapes by RNG artists as a harbinger of RNG notions of peace.



Ironically, with the "return" of the foreign concessions to RNG rule in 1943, the Japanese ordered that symbols of Western imperialism be removed from Shanghai's streets. This, of course, included Fehr's Allied War Monument (with Victory herself being removed, but her plinth left intact). The "angel of peace" thus provides us with an insight not simply into the eclectic origins of many of the symbols adopted by the RNG, and the creative ways in which this regime appropriated pre-war symbols of peace into a wartime cultures of occupation. It also illustrates the limits of RNG autonomy when it came to constructing visual cultures under foreign domination.
